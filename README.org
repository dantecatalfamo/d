* Repo

A small tool written to help manage the my =~/src= directory.
Written in [[https://raku.org/][raku]] as an exercise.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC
usage: repo <command> [<args>]

Commands:
  cd      Change to a project directory under ~/src
  clone   Clone a repository into ~/src according to the site, user, and project
#+END_SRC

* Example
  Running ~repo clone https://github.com/dantecatalfamo/repo~ would
  clone https://github.com/dantecatalfamo/repo into the directory
  =~/src/github.com/dantecatalfamo/repo=, then change to that
  directory.

  Running ~repo cd repo~ changes to
  =~/src/github.com/dantecatalfamo/repo= if it's the only directory
  that matches that query. Otherwise it displays a list of projects
  matching that pattern, allowing the user to select the desired
  project. The query is matches against the entire path after =~src/=.
